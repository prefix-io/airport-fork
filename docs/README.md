# Airport Extension for DuckDB

The **Airport** extension brings [Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) support to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), enabling DuckDB to query, modify, and store data via Arrow Flight servers. A DuckDB extension is a plugin that expands DuckDB's core functionality by adding new capabilities.

To understand the rationale behind the development of this extension, check out the [motivation for creating the extension](https://airport.query.farm/motivation.html).

# Documentation

Visit the [documentation for this extension](https://airport.query.farm).

# Building the extension

```sh
# Clone this repo with submodules.
# duckdb and extension-ci-tools are submodules.
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Query-farm/duckdb-airport-extension

# Clone the vcpkg repo
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

# Bootstrap vcpkg
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Build the extension
make

# If you have ninja installed, you can use it to speed up the build
# GEN=ninja make
```

The main binaries that will be built are:
```sh
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/test/unittest
./build/release/extension/airport/airport.duckdb_extension
```

- `duckdb` is the binary for the duckdb shell with the extension code automatically loaded.
- `unittest` is the test runner of duckdb. Again, the extension is already linked into the binary.
- `airport.duckdb_extension` is the loadable binary as it would be distributed.

## Running the extension

To run the extension code, simply start the shell with `./build/release/duckdb`. This duckdb shell will have the extension pre-loaded.

Now we can use the features from the extension directly in DuckDB.

## Running the tests
Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:

```sh
make test
```
